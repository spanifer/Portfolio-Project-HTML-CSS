# Portfolio Project 1

Getting ready to **_shine_** âœ¨

___

## Initial ideas the project is built upon

### Main idea

+ A historic view of vintage cars, and initial acceptance by society.
+ First mass produced combustion engine and/or steam engine cars.
+ Technologies used 
+ Driving experience compared to next-to-present technological advancement

### Dream to accomplish

I want to showcase what I already know, and also experiment on what is possible particularly with css animations.

1. I want to see a html-css based animation of a simplified outline of a vintage car, being a short _introduction_ page for the website, the final state also being the logo for the website.

2. I need a home page with a timeline with the first few years of cars being tested and used on roads, driving experience, comparison, technologies, (and an accompanying video)

3. I need an event page for recent and future exhibitions and such.

4. Depending on available content I could include a gallery.

5. A become a member form or register for upcoming event notification form.

6. A hidden page to respond to the form.

### Strategy

#### Definition

Creating a website about Cars and how they came to be, for a wide target audience from *children* to __enthusiast__

The content specifically focuses on Cars becoming a reality, so whoever is interested in that topic should find this site sufficient and informative.

#### Value

It needs to be visually appealing so much so that less interested visitors about the topic gets convinced to explore the site. Expecting the initial short intro animation to excite interest.

The site could incorporate a club section for enthusiasts where they could meet and showcase own valuable assets.

#### Focus

--- | --- | ---

Member registration | 4 | 3
Upcoming events subscription | 5 | 4
Gallery page | 3 | 4
Overall landing page | 5 | 5
