# Portfolio Project 1

Getting ready to **_shine_** âœ¨

___

## Initial ideas the project is built upon

### Main idea

+ A historic view of vintage cars, and initial acceptance by society.
+ First mass produced combustion engine and/or steam engine cars.
+ Technologies used 
+ Driving experience compared to next-to-present technological advancement

### Dream to accomplish

I want to showcase what I already know, and also experiment on what is possible particularly with css animations.

1. I want to see a html-css based animation of a simplified outline of a vintage car, being a short _introduction_ page for the website, the final state also being the logo for the website.

2. I need a home page with a timeline with the first few years of cars being tested and used on roads, driving experience, comparison, technologies, (and an accompanying video)

3. I need an event page for recent and future exhibitions and such.

4. Depending on available content I could include a gallery.

5. A become a member form or register for upcoming event notification form.

6. A hidden page to respond to the form.
