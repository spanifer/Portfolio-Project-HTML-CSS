                    Other than being retro, the driving experience greatly differs from today mainstream cars.

                    <p>The first working steam-powered vehicle was designed and quite possibly built by Ferdinand Verbiest, around 1672.</p>
                    <p>In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the
                        first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle.</p>
                    <p>A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars,
                        steam buses, phaetons, and steam rollers. In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.</p>
                    <p>In 1896, Karl Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor. During the last years
                        of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899</p>
                    <p>In 1895, James Duryea established the first American automobile manufacturing company. The American automobile industry
                        was born as Duryea started the manufacturing of the first 13 vehicles in 1896.</p>

                    <h3>The dawn of the 20th century</h3>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>Large-scale, production-line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in 1901 at his Oldsmobile factory in
                        Lansing, Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block
                        Mills, England, in 1802. The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the U.S. by
                        Thomas Blanchard in 1821, at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. Later this concept was greatly expanded by Henry
                        Ford.</p>
                    <p>In 1908 the Ford Motor Company produced the famous Model T. The idea was to produce a motor car that the average person
                        could afford, operate, and maintain. The first Model T sold for $850.00.</p>
                    <p>By developing the first assembly line in 1914 the New Model T’s now come off the assembly line at the rate of one car every 24
                        seconds. By 1915 the price of a Model T had dropped to $440.00, and by 1925 a Model T could be bought for $290.00. The early
                        1900’s cars now are within reach of the average car buyer.</p>
                    <p>In the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford
                        Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, Citroën was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the
                        production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had
                        disappeared.</p>
